Once upon a time there was a monkey who loved jamuns. Once a crocodile asked him "What are you eating ?".
The monkey just replied"these are world famous jamuns, present in the same museum which has
 the Mona Lisa Painting , here you go!" And with that, the monkey tossed the jamuns to the crocodile.
